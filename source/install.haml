    %h2 There are a couple of ways to start using&nbsp;Sass:
    %ol
      %li.gui-application
        %h3 1. Applications
        %p There are a a good many applications that will get you up and running with Sass in a few minutes for Mac, Windows, and Linux. You can download most of the applications for free but a few of them are paid apps <small>(and totally worth it)</small>.

        / The applications are listed in alphabetical order. As new applications are released they should be added to the list.

        %h3 2. Command Line

        #install-ruby-linux
          %strong 1. Linux
          %p If you're using a distribution of Linux, you'll need to install Ruby first. You can use --something--, or --something--, or --something else--.

        #install-ruby-windows
          %strong 1. Windows
          %p Before you start using Sass you will need to install Ruby. The fastest way to get Ruby on your Windows computer is to use <a href="http://www.rubyinstaller.org">Ruby Installer</a>. It's a single-click installer that will get everything set up for you super fast.

          %p Along with Ruby the installer will also install a Ruby command line application that you will let you use the Ruby libraries. Open --application name--.

        #install-ruby-mac
          %strong 1. Mac
          %p If you prefer the command line over an application then getting Sass set up is a fairly quick process. Sass has a Ruby dependency but if you're using a Mac, congratulations, Ruby comes pre-installed.

        %p Here's the quickest way we've found to start using Sass by using the command line:

        %ol
          %li
            %p <strong>2. Open your command line application.</strong> On the Mac the Terminal.app comes installed by default. It's located in your "Utilities" folder.
          %li
            %p <strong>3. Install Sass.</strong> Ruby uses Gems to manage it's various packages of code like Sass. In your open terminal window type:
            %pre
              :preserve
                gem install sass
            %p This will install Sass and any dependencies for you. It's pretty magical.
          %li
            %p <strong>4. Double-check.</strong> You should now have Sass installed, but it never hurts to double-check. In your terminal application you can type:
            %pre
              :preserve
                sass -v
            %p It should return <code>Sass #{data.version.number} (#{data.version.name})</code>. Congratulations! You've successfully installed Sass.
          %li
            %p <strong>5. Go and play.</strong> If you're brand new to Sass we've set up some resources to help you learn pretty darn quick.
